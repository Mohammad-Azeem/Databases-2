1.
Connect to both databases and create a table whose name is PR01 and has 1 column. 
The column contains the table names of owner NIKOVITS having  a letter 'B' in its name.
You do not have to upload or send the solution, I will check it in the databases.

Do not forget to run the following command:

GRANT SELECT ON PR01 TO LKPETER;

2.
Write a PL/SQL procedure, which prints out for the parameter user his/her newest table (which was created last),
the size of the table in bytes (the size of the table's segment) and the creation date. 
The output format should be the following.
(Number of spaces doesn't count between the columns, date format is yyyy.mm.dd:hh24:mi)

Table_name: NNNNNN   Size: SSSSSS bytes   Created: yyyy.mm.dd.hh:mi

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE newest_table(p_user VARCHAR2) IS 
...
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
EXECUTE newest_table('NIKOVITS');

Check your solution with the following procedure:
EXECUTE check_plsql('newest_table(''nikovits'')');

Check_plsql will call your procedure and compare your output with the correct output 
character by character. That's why the format of the output is important.

Hint:
Find the creation date of the object (table) in DBA_OBJECTS, then find the segment(s) of the table
in DBA_SEGMENTS.

3.
Write a PL/SQL procedure which counts and prints the number of empty blocks of a table.
Output format -> Empty Blocks: nnn

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE empty_blocks(p_owner VARCHAR2, p_table VARCHAR2) IS
...
Test:
-----
set serveroutput on
EXECUTE empty_blocks('nikovits', 'employees');

Check your solution with the following procedure:
EXECUTE check_plsql('empty_blocks(''nikovits'', ''employees'')');

Hint: 
Count the total number of blocks (see the segment), the filled blocks (use ROWID), 
the difference is the number of empty blocks.
